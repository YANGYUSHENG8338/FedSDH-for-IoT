### [AR Face Dataset](https://www2.ece.ohio-state.edu/~aleix/ARdatabase.html):
* Records 13 different facial expressions.
* Involves individuals wearing sunglasses or scarves for concealment.

### [Jaffe Dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/jaffe):
* Involved ten Japanese women participants.
* Captures seven different facial emotions.

### [ORL Dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/orl):
* Created by AT&T Cambridge Laboratory.
* Comprises 40 different subjects.
* Contains variations in lighting angles, facial details (with/without glasses), and facial expressions (open/closed eyes, smiling/non-smiling).

### [Yale Dataset](https://cvc.cs.yale.edu/cvc/projects/yalefaces/yalefaces.html):
* Created by Yale University.
* Consists of 15 individuals with 11 images each.
* Showcases facial expressions under different lighting conditions.
